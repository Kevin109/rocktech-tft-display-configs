# Linux Device Tree Configs for Rockchip SBCs with Rocktech TFT Displays

This repository provides pre-tested Device Tree Source (DTS) configurations for integrating Rocktech TFT LCD display modules with popular Rockchip-based Single Board Computers (SBCs), including RK3566, RK3568, PX30, and others. It aims to help embedded Linux and Android developers quickly bring up display interfaces in custom or commercial projects.

## ✨ Features

- 📌 Ready-to-use `.dts` and `.dtsi` configuration files
- 🧩 Supports Rocktech TFT LCD modules like RK050HR18, RK070CU01
- 🛠️ Compatible with Android and Linux kernel (4.19/5.10/5.15)
- ✅ Validated on PX30, RK3566 SBC platforms
- 🔧 Easily adaptable to custom SBC designs

## 📚 Use Case: Rapid Prototyping

When developing a new product with a Rockchip SoC and TFT LCD, our team typically:
1. Selects a matching Rocktech TFT panel
2. Creates a breakout board for quick bring-up
3. Uses these DTS configs to verify display output before finalizing the SBC design
